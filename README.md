This is an implementation of [FastCGI](http://www.fastcgi.com/devkit/doc/fcgi-spec.html) for .NET, written in C#. It implements the parts of the protocol that are necessary to build a simple web application using .NET.

This means that you can write web applications in C# that serve dynamic content.

## Documentation

The project documentation is hosted here: [fastcgi-for-net.readthedocs.org](http://fastcgi-for-net.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)

The user guide is mostly the same as this readme. [Here is a direct link to the API reference](http://fastcgi-for-net.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api_reference).

## Nuget

The library is available via [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/FastCGI/). To install, type this in the package manager console:

    Install-Package FastCGI

Or, using the command-line interface:

    nuget install FastCGI

For more information, refer to the [NuGet documentation](https://docs.nuget.org/consume).

## Basic usage

The most common usage scenario is to use this library together with a web server like Apache and nginx. The web server will serve static content and forward HTTP requests for dynamic content to your application.

Have a look at the FastCGI.FCGIApplication class for usage examples and more information.

This code example shows how to create a FastCGI application and receive requests:

```csharp
// Create a new FCGIApplication, will accept FastCGI requests
var app = new FCGIApplication();

// Handle requests by responding with a 'Hello World' message
app.OnRequestReceived += (sender, request) =>
{
    var responseString =
          "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n"
        + "Content-Type:text/html\n"
        + "\n"
        + "Hello World!";

    request.WriteResponseASCII(responseString);
    request.Close();
};

// Start listening on port 19000
app.Run(19000);
```

## Web server configuration

For nginx, use `fastcgi_pass` to pass requests to your FastCGI application:

    location / {
        fastcgi_pass   127.0.0.1:19000; # Pass all requests to port 19000 via FastCGI.
        include fastcgi_params; # (Optional): Set several FastCGI parameters like the remote IP and other metadata.
    }

For more details, refer to your web server documentation for configuration details:

 * [Apache documentation](http://httpd.apache.org/mod_fcgid/mod/mod_fcgid.html)
